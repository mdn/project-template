# Contribution roles

Welcome to the MDN project! Here we take you through the different roles you can assume as part of contributing to the MDN Web Docs project. There is usually a step-by-step progress from one role to the next as you take on more responsibilites. We describe here how you can move from one role to the next. You could also directly assume a role if you have expertise in a particluar area. We discuss this under [Invited expert](#invited-expert). As you'll see, with the advancement in the contrinution ladder, you could serve more than one role at the same time.

Contributing to MDN is a mutually beneficial relationship. Your contributions help this open source project immensely. You can use this project to demonstrate your technical and writing skills and as well as your ability to participate in team settings and engage with folks from diverse backgrounds.

## Roles

At the base of all roles is the role of a community participant. You wear this hat irrespective of any other role you take on.

### Community participant

A community participant engages with the project and its community by contributing their time, opinions, and ideas.
Community participants are usually users who have stopped being anonymous and started being active in project discussions. Community participants can get involved with the community in the following ways:

- Participating in community [discussions](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-community/discussions)
- Helping other users
- Submitting bug reports
- Commenting on issues
- Attending community events

#### Responsibilities

## Invited expert

Invited Experts are responsible for a specific topic area or project component smaller than an entire project.
Invited Experts are automatically assigned for review when pull requests are opened in their topic area.
If there is more than one topic expert, reviewers are assigned using a [load-balancing strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-code-review-settings-for-your-team#about-auto-assignment).

Invited Experts have a track record of contributions, participation, and reviews, or have proven knowledge in a certain area of expertise.
They, together with other Reviewers, are responsible for reviewing changes in their topic area and approving pull requests for merge.

- The nominee will add a comment to the pull request agreeing to all responsibilities of becoming an Invited Expert.
- To be accepted, the pull request needs three approvals. This can be any combination of Invited Experts, or Maintainers.
- Once the pull request is approved, the new Invited Expert is added to the [invited-experts team](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/teams/invited-experts) and the appropriate topic team.

### Invited experts responsibilities

## Maintainer

  - Propose, approve, or implement code and infrastructure improvements.
  - Propose, approve, or implement content improvements.

## Community Manager

The Community Manager role is distinct in many respects. Still, as the projects are technical, the role shares many of the same requirements and responsibilities as the Maintainer role.

In addition to the responsibilities of a Maintainer, the Community Manager has these additional responsibilities.

- Along with Maintainers, address reports where the code of conduct has been violated and decide on the appropriate action.
- Organize and run community events.

- Ensure the health and well-being of the project and all participants.
- Identify and assist with the implementation of automation to improve project sustainability.

## Workflows

## Turning inactive

Participants must be active to set an example and show commitment to the project.
Conversely, inactivity harms the project as it may lead to unexpected delays, contributor attrition, and a loss of trust in the project.

Inactivity is measured by:

- Periods of no contributions for longer than six months.
- Periods of no communication for longer than three months.

Consequences of being inactive include:

- Involuntary removal or demotion
- Being asked to move to Emeritus status

### Involuntary Removal or Demotion

Involuntary removal/demotion of a contributor happens when responsibilities and requirements aren't being met.
This may include repeated patterns of inactivity, a period of failing to meet the requirements of the role, or a violation of the Code of Conduct.
This process is essential because it protects the community and its deliverables while also opening up opportunities for new contributors to step in.

During a maintainers meeting, a participant can ask to demote or remove a contributor.
In addition, the participant is responsible for adding supporting information to the meeting agenda.
Finally, the matter will be discussed and brought to a vote by all maintainers and community managers.

Please communicate with the community team to avoid the above process should your time commitments change.
In these cases, you can instead proactively choose to step down for a while or move to Emeritus status (see below).

## Stepping Down/Emeritus Process

If and when contributors' commitment levels change, contributors can consider stepping down (moving down the contributor ladder) vs moving to Emeritus status (completely stepping away from the project).

Contact the community team about changing to Emeritus status, or reducing your contributor level.
