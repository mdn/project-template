# Contributor roles

Community contributions help this open source project immensely.
In return, contributors can use their work on this project to demonstrate their writing and technical skills as well as their ability to collaborate in team settings and engage with people from diverse backgrounds.

This page describes the different roles you can assume while volunteering on the MDN Web Docs project.

Invited experts are automatically assigned for review when pull requests are opened in their topic area.

### Stepping down voluntarily

Participants must be active to set an example and show commitment to the project.
Conversely, inactivity harms the project as it may lead to unexpected delays, contributor attrition, and a loss of trust in the project.

Inactivity is measured by:

- Periods of no contributions for longer than six months.
- Periods of no communication for longer than three months.

Consequences of being inactive include:

- Involuntary removal or demotion
- Being asked to move to [emeritus status](#gaining-emeritus-status)

### Gaining emeritus status

If and when contributors' commitment levels change, contributors can consider stepping down (moving down the contributor ladder) vs moving to emeritus status (completely stepping away from the project).
Contact the community team about moving to emeritus status or reducing your contributor level.

### Getting demoted involuntarily

Involuntary removal/demotion of a contributor happens when responsibilities and requirements aren't being met.
This may include repeated patterns of inactivity, a period of failing to meet the requirements of the role, or a violation of the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
This process is essential because it protects the community and its deliverables while also opening up opportunities for new contributors to step in.

During a maintainers meeting, a participant can ask to demote or remove a contributor.
In addition, the participant is responsible for adding supporting information to the meeting agenda.
Finally, the matter will be discussed and brought to a vote by all maintainers and community managers.

Please communicate with the community team to avoid the above process should your time commitments change.
In these cases, you can instead proactively choose to step down for a while or move to [emeritus status](#gaining-emeritus-status).
